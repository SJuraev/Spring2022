Difference between single | and double||:

When || is used, it will not execute the next part of the comparison if the
previous part is true. Since for conditional OR one true is enough to return true.

What do we get in ROI(Return on investment)?
We get faster execution, so we save time.

Difference between && and & =>
&& will return false if the first comparison is false.
So it's not even going to check the second part.

& - > Check both sides anyway.
